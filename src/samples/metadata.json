      "description": "The United Nations recommended romanization\nsystem was approved in 1972 (resolution II/8),\nbased on the system adopted by Arabic experts at\nthe conference held at Beirut in 1971 with the\npractical amendments carried out and agreed upon\nby the representatives of the Arabic-speaking\ncountries at their conference. The table was\npublished in volume II of the conference report1\n. In the UN resolution it was specifically\npointed out that the system was recommended \"for\nthe romanization of the geographical names within\nthose Arabic-speaking countries where this system\nis officially acknowledged\". It cannot be\ndefinitely ascertained which of the\nArabicspeaking countries have adopted this system\nofficially, especially since 2007 when there are\nefforts by the Arabic Division to promote a\nmodification of the UN system (ADEGN\nromanization, see the section on other\nromanization systems below), with varying\nsuccess2 . Judging by the use of names in\ninternational cartographic products which rely\nmostly on national sources it appears that the UN\nsystem or its modification is more or less\ncurrent in Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia3 ,\nUnited Arab Emirates and Yemen, there and in some\nother countries the system is often used without\ndiacritical marks. For the geographical names of\nthe Syrian Arab Republic international maps\nfavour the UN system while the local usage seems\nto prefer a French-oriented romanization. Also in\nEgypt and Sudan there exist local romanization\nschemes or practices side by side with the UN\nsystem. The geographical names of Algeria,\nDjibouti, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are\ngenerally rendered in the traditional manner\nwhich conforms to the principles of the French\northography. Resolution 7 of the Seventh UN\nConference on the Standardization of Geographical\nNames (1998) recommended that \"the League of Arab\nStates should, through its specialized\nstructures, continue its efforts to organize a\nconference with a view to considering the\ndifficulties encountered in applying the amended\nBeirut system of 1972 for the romanization of\nArabic script, and submit, as soon as possible, a\nsolution to the United Nations Group of Experts\non Geographical Names\". At the Eighth UN\nConference on the Standardization of Geographical\nNames (2002), the Arabic Division of the UN Group\nof Experts announced that it had finalised\nproposed modifications to the UN recommended\nromanization system. These proposals would be\nsubmitted to the League of Arab States for\napproval. Arabic is written from right to left.\nThe Arabic script usually omits vowel points and\ndiacritical marks from writing which makes it\ndifficult to obtain uniform results in the\nromanization of Arabic. It is essential to\nidentify correctly the words which appear in any\nparticular name and to know the standard Arabic-\nscript spelling including proper pointing. One\nmust also take into account dialectal and\nidiosyncratic deviations. The romanization is\ngenerally reversible though there are some\nambiguous letter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which\nmay also point to combinations of Arabic\ncharacters in addition to the respective single\ncharacters.\n",

It is not intended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute\nforensic information. Rather, it is to provide an IC standard Romanized (English)\ntransliteration from standard Hindi and Urdu that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nThere are typically a number of ways that names can be Romanized from either\nDevanagari (Hindi) or modified Arabic (Urdu) scripts. Ambiguities can result from the\nRomanization of Hindi and Urdu names for several reasons, including the fact that some\nsounds in South Asian languages (e.g., retroflex consonants, voiced aspirates) have no\nequivalent in English or other European languages. In the case of Urdu, as in the original\nArabic source of many Islamic names, short vowel markings, double consonant marks\nand other diacritics that would clearly distinguish the name are almost always omitted\nfrom standard written texts. And many Islamic names of Arabic or Persian origin reflect\nspelling distinctions from those languages that are lost in modern Urdu pronunciation\n(e.g., three distinct Arabic letters all represent the identical sound [s] for Urdu speakers);\ntransliterations might either maintain those spelling distinctions or ignore them entirely.\nAnd, as in the Arabic source, names containing the Arabic definite article ‘al’ (‘ul’) show\nanticipatory assimilation in pronunciation (e.g., Shams al Din > Shamsuddin);\ntransliterations may either reflect spelling or pronunciation in such cases.\n\nBecause Hindi and Urdu overlap so extensively, it is desirable to correlate Hindi and\nUrdu transliterations as much as possible. In the area of names, this can become\nproblematic when the Urdu spelling accurately reflects original Arabic spelling while the\nHindi spelling was phonetically-based, in essence, already a transliteration. This would\nargue for ignoring Arabic/Urdu spelling distinctions not reflected in pronunciation in\neither Urdu or Hindi (e.g., letter sin versus letter sad) while maintaining Arabic/Urdu\nspelling distinctions like Hindi also maintains (e.g., qaf as in Qutubbin versus kaf)).\nHowever, this is not always possible (see Hindi va versus Urdu wau).\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated, that is to be indicated\n– as found – in parentheses immediately following its rendition in the transliteration\nstandard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (Mohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original\nDevanagari or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should also appear in\nparentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Hindi- or Urdu-speaking\ncommunity, use the relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language\n(e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of\nthe person. Spell names of individuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as\nthey are spelled in those languages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges\nPompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and\nthe on-line directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments,\nthe spellings given in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC\nStandard. For any individual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of\nState directory but who no longer appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a\ngovernment official), the IC Standard spelling should appear first, with the spelling, if\nknown, as it previously appeared in those resources listed within parentheses at the first\nusage.\n\nThe primary goal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of the\nname that is readable to the non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without\nthe use of diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional\ninformation about the individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified.\nAdditionally, this system will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries\nand lists containing conventional spellings of names of well-known individuals\n",

It is a native\nofficial system designed to reflect Afghan names, both Dari and Pashto,\nand both pronunciation and genuine linguistic truth.]\n\nThe tables function as both a romanization system for Afghanistan (i.e.\nwith access to the original script, these tables can be applied to get\na standardized Roman result - moving from columns 1 to 3) and as a\nmeans of converting the available Yaghoubi Roman-script spellings, as\nappear on the Fairchild Aerial Surveys map series, to standard BGN/PCGN\nspellings (moving from columns 2 to 3).\n\nThe points used in Arabic to mark short vowels and certain other\ndiacritical marks are infrequently written in Afghanistan.\nConsequently, a reference source may sometimes be required to aid\ncorrect identification of the standard spellings and proper vowels and\nelimination of dialectal and idiosyncratic variations. In the interests\nof clarity, the example columns show script with vowel pointing from\nArabic to indicate the short vowels that are included alongside the\nunpointed form that will usually be encountered. However it should be\nnoted that the pronunciation of short vowels will vary.\n\nNote: it is recommended that a font such as Scheherazade, available\nfrom www.sil.org, which includes the Unicode extended Arabic sub-range,\nbe used to view this system.

Although the BGN/PCGN policy for\ngeographical names in Afghanistan is to apply the BGN/PCGN\nnational system of romanization for Afghanistan (2007),\nwhich incorporates Dari elements, when applied to a Pashto\ngeographical name, the romanized results of the BGN/PCGN\nnational system for Afghanistan are the same as those of\nthis Pashto romanization system1 . The Pashto alphabet uses\na modified form of the Perso-Arabic script, and contains\ntwelve additional consonants not present in standard\nArabic, as well as three additional vowel characters and an\nadditional vowel point. ڼ گ ښ ژ ږ ړ ډ ځ څ چ ټ پ :Consonants\nٙ :Point Vowel; ې ۍ ى :Vowels The points used in Arabic to\nmark short vowels and certain other diacritical marks are\nnot written in Pashto.

In the interests of\nclarity, a column showing vowel pointing from Arabic to\nindicate short vowels has been included in the examples\nbelow, alongside the unpointed form that will usually be\nencountered.

Rather, it is to provide an\nIC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Chechen that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first\nusage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example: Ilyas\nAkhmadkant (also seen as Ilyas Axmadkhant, Ильяс Ахмадкӏант). This convention is designed\nto ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Chechen-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A\ntranslator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the online\ndirectory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any\nindividual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no\nlonger appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those\nresources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will\noccur without the use of diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional\ninformation about the individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system\nwill be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing\nconventional spellings of names of well-known individuals.\n",

      "description": "This part of ISO 233 is one of a series of International\nStandards, dealing with the conversion of systems of\nwriting. The aim of this part of ISO 233 and others in the\nseries is to provide a means for international\ncommunication of written messages in a form which permits\nthe automatic transmission and reconstitution of these, by\nmen or machines. The system of conversion, in this case,\nmust be univocal and entirely reversible. This means that\nno consideration should be given to phonetic and aesthetic\nmatters or to certain national customs: all these\nconsiderations are, indeed, ignored by the machine\nperforming the function. The adoption of this part of ISO\n233 for international communication leaves every country\nfree to adopt for its own use a national standard which may\nbe different, on condition that it is compatible with this\npart of ISO 233. The system proposed herein should make\nthis possible and be acceptable to international use if the\ngraphisms it creates are such that they may be converted\nautomatically into the graphisms used in any strict\nnational systems. This part of ISO 233 may be used by\nanyone who has a clear understanding of the system and is\ncertain that it can be applied without ambiguity. The\nresult obtained will not give a correct pronunciation of\nthe original text in a person’s own language, but it will\nserve as a means of finding automatically the original\ngraphism and thus allow anyone who has knowledge of the\noriginal language to pronounce it correctly. Similarly, one\ncan only pronounce correctly a text written in, for\nexample, English or Polish, if one has a knowledge of\nEnglish or Polish. The adoption of national standards\ncompatible with this part of ISO 233 will permit the\nrepresentation, in an international publication, of the\nmorphemes of each language according to the customs of the\ncountry where it is spoken. It will be possible to simplify\nthis representation in order to take into account the\nnumber of the character sets available on different kinds\nof machines.\n1-Scope:\nThis part of ISO 233 establishes a simplified\nsystem for the transliteration of Persian characters into\nLatin characters. This simplification of the stringent\nrules established by ISO 233:1984 is especially intended to\nfacilitate the processing of bibliographic information (\ne.g. catalogues, indices, citations, etc.)\n2-Normative references:\nThe following normative documents contain\nprovisions which, though reference in this text, constitute\nprovisions of this part of ISO 233. For dated references,\nsubsequent amendments to, or revisions of, any of these\npublications do not apply. However, parties to agreements\nbased on this part of ISO 233 are encouraged to investigate\nthe possibility of applying the most recent editions of the\nnormative documents indicated below. For undated\nreferences, the latest edition of the normative document\nreferred to applies. Members of ISO and IEC maintain\nregisters of currently valid International StandardsISO 233-\n2, Information and documentation — Transliteration of\nArabic characters into Latin characters — Part 2: Arabic\nlanguage — Simplified transliteration.

      "description": "This system is the Intelligence Community (IC) standard for the transliteration of names\nfrom Hindi and Urdu that will be applied to all final written reports and products for IC\nconsumers. It is not intended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute\nforensic information. Rather, it is to provide an IC standard Romanized (English)\ntransliteration from standard Hindi and Urdu that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nThere are typically a number of ways that names can be Romanized from either\nDevanagari (Hindi) or modified Arabic (Urdu) scripts. Ambiguities can result from the\nRomanization of Hindi and Urdu names for several reasons, including the fact that some\nsounds in South Asian languages (e.g., retroflex consonants, voiced aspirates) have no\nequivalent in English or other European languages. In the case of Urdu, as in the original\nArabic source of many Islamic names, short vowel markings, double consonant marks\nand other diacritics that would clearly distinguish the name are almost always omitted\nfrom standard written texts. And many Islamic names of Arabic or Persian origin reflect\nspelling distinctions from those languages that are lost in modern Urdu pronunciation\n(e.g., three distinct Arabic letters all represent the identical sound [s] for Urdu speakers);\ntransliterations might either maintain those spelling distinctions or ignore them entirely.\nAnd, as in the Arabic source, names containing the Arabic definite article ‘al’ (‘ul’) show\nanticipatory assimilation in pronunciation (e.g., Shams al Din > Shamsuddin);\ntransliterations may either reflect spelling or pronunciation in such cases.\n\nBecause Hindi and Urdu overlap so extensively, it is desirable to correlate Hindi and\nUrdu transliterations as much as possible. In the area of names, this can become\nproblematic when the Urdu spelling accurately reflects original Arabic spelling while the\nHindi spelling was phonetically-based, in essence, already a transliteration. This would\nargue for ignoring Arabic/Urdu spelling distinctions not reflected in pronunciation in\neither Urdu or Hindi (e.g., letter sin versus letter sad) while maintaining Arabic/Urdu\nspelling distinctions like Hindi also maintains (e.g., qaf as in Qutubbin versus kaf)).\nHowever, this is not always possible (see Hindi va versus Urdu wau).\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated, that is to be indicated\n– as found – in parentheses immediately following its rendition in the transliteration\nstandard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (Mohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original\nDevanagari or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should also appear in\nparentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Hindi- or Urdu-speaking\ncommunity, use the relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language\n(e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of\nthe person. Spell names of individuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as\nthey are spelled in those languages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges\nPompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and\nthe on-line directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments,\nthe spellings given in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC\nStandard. For any individual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of\nState directory but who no longer appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a\ngovernment official), the IC Standard spelling should appear first, with the spelling, if\nknown, as it previously appeared in those resources listed within parentheses at the first\nusage.\n\nThe primary goal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of the\nname that is readable to the non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without\nthe use of diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional\ninformation about the individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified.\nAdditionally, this system will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries\nand lists containing conventional spellings of names of well-known individuals\n",

The table was published in volume\nII of the conference report.\nIn UN resolution XI/3 it is specifically stated that the\nsystem was recommended for the “romanization of the\ngeographical names within those Arabic-speaking countries\nwhere this system is officially adopted”. There is\nevidence of its partial implementation in Jordan, Oman and\nSaudi Arabia. The UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization\nSystems intends to continue monitoring the UN system’s\nimplementation across Arabic-speaking countries.\nIn some countries there exist local romanization schemes\nor practices. The geographical names of Algeria, Djibouti,\nMauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are generally rendered in\nthe traditional manner which conforms to the principles of\nthe French orthography.\nThe previous UN-approved system is still found in\nconsiderable international usage.\nArabic is written from right to left. The Arabic script\nusually omits vowel points and diacritical marks from\nwriting which makes it difficult to obtain uniform results\nin the romanization of Arabic. It is essential to identify\ncorrectly the words which appear in any particular name\nand to know the standard Arabic-script spelling including\nthe relevant vowels. One must also take into account\ndialectal and idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization\nis generally reversible though there may be some ambiguous\nletter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which may also point to\ncombinations of Arabic characters in addition to the\nrespective single characters.\n",

It is based on a scheme that emerged during the nineteenth century from suggestions by Charles Trevelyan, William Jones, Monier Monier-Williams and other scholars, and formalised by the Transliteration Committee of the Geneva Oriental Congress, in September 1894.IAST makes it possible for the reader to read the Indic text unambiguously, exactly as if it were in the original Indic script.

It follows that for correct identification of the words which appear in any particular name, knowledge of its standard Arabic-script spelling including proper pointing, and recognition of dialectal and idiosyncratic deviations are essential.\n\nIn order to bring about uniformity in the Roman-script spelling of geographical names in Arabic-language areas, the system is based insofar as possible on fully pointed Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). In the interest of clarity, vowel pointing to indicate short vowels has been applied to the examples given below, and examples of the, more usual, unpointed script have also been provided; it should also be noted that the dots which occur on some characters of the Arabic script are not vowels but rather are an integral part of the base consonant.\n\nArabic script is written from right to left, and does not make a distinction between upper and lower case.\n",

A few of the letters (f, k, p, v) were rarely used,\nbeing found only in borrowings, while q, w and x were excluded\naltogether. Since k transcribed [h] in loans, it is unclear how loans\nin [kʰ] were written. \"j\" is used for vowel combinations of the [ja]\ntype. Letter \"c\" is used for the sound [ts] and \"k\" is used for the\nound [h]. The first version was inspired by the Yanalif script used\nfor the Soviet Union's Turkic languages.\n\nThe orthography of the Mongolian Latin is based on the orthography of\nthe Classical Mongolian script. It preserves short final vowels. It\ndoes not drop unstressed vowels in the closing syllables when the word\nis conjugated. The suffixes and inflections without long or i-coupled\nvowels are made open syllables ending with a vowel, which is harmonized\nwith the stressed vowel. The rule for the vowel harmony for unstressed\nvowels is similar to that of the Mongolian Cyrillic. It does not use\nconsonant combinations to denote new consonant sounds. For both of the\nversion, letter \"b\" is used both in the beginning and in the middle of\nthe word. Because it phonetically assimilates into sound [w], no\nambiguity is caused.\n",

It Is\nused for the romanization of standard geographic names in\nIran.\nThe Persian alphabet is the same as the Arabic alphabet\nexcept for the addition of four consonant symbols for\nsounds which do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, the same\nconversion values are used for the Persian alphabet as for\nthe Arabic alphabet wherever phonetically valid. Where\nletters common to the two alphabets have different\npronunciation in the two languages, conversion values\nreflecting the Persian pronunciation are provided in the\nPersian system.\nIt may be noted that neither the system of pointing nor the\nconversion values for vowels and diphthongs are the same\nfor Persian as for Arabic.\nPersian presents the same problems of vowel pointing as\nArabic in that the short vowel symbols necessary for the\nproper rendering of short vowels, long vowels, and\ndiphthongs are almost always omitted from written Persian.\nIt follows that, in order to produce transliter- tions in\nterms of standard written Persian, the transliterator must\nbe able to identify the words used in names and must know\ntheir standard written Persian spelling, their proper vowel\npointing, and how to eliminate pecularities due to\ndialectical variation.\nThe notes and special rules explain details of\ntransliteration not stated in the tables.\n",

It is\nnot intended to eliminate variations of a name that can\ncontribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide\nan IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from\nmodern standard Arabic that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of\nthe name. Ambiguities can result from the Romanization of\nArabic names because the Arabic source generally omits\nshort vowel markings, double consonant marks, and other\ndiacritics that would clearly distinguish the name.\nLinguists use their experience with the language and aids\nsuch as on-line tools and name dictionaries to determine\nthe exact Arabic and the appropriate transliteration into\nthe Roman alphabet. In cases where an individual's name has\nalready been transliterated, that is to be indicated -- as\nfound -- in parentheses immediately following its rendition\nin the transliteration standard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (\nMohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original Arabic-\nscript spelling is known, that spelling should also appear\nin parentheses following the name, if possible, following\nbest practices of the issuing organization and taking into\nconsideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic\ninformation is not lost. For names of persons who are known\nto not be part of the Arabic-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that\nlanguage (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may\nbe used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell\nnames of individuals from languages that are written in\nRoman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou). In the\ncase of active senior government officials in the on-line\nCIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of\nState and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the\nspellings given in these on-line reference works should be\nused in place of the IC Standard. For any individual who\nhas at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of\nState directory but who no longer appears in those\nresources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, with the spelling,\nif known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage. The primary\ngoal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized\ntranscription of the name that is readable to the non-\nspecialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard (\nEnglish) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe. Some\nambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the\nuse of diacritics. However, within the context of a report,\nwhere additional information about the individual is\nprovided, the referent will be clearly identified. This\nsystem will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name\ndictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings\nof names of well-known individuals.\n",

It is a native\nofficial system designed to reflect Afghan names, both Dari and Pashto,\nand both pronunciation and genuine linguistic truth.]\n\nThe tables function as both a romanization system for Afghanistan (i.e.\nwith access to the original script, these tables can be applied to get\na standardized Roman result - moving from columns 1 to 3) and as a\nmeans of converting the available Yaghoubi Roman-script spellings, as\nappear on the Fairchild Aerial Surveys map series, to standard BGN/PCGN\nspellings (moving from columns 2 to 3).\n\nThe points used in Arabic to mark short vowels and certain other\ndiacritical marks are infrequently written in Afghanistan.\nConsequently, a reference source may sometimes be required to aid\ncorrect identification of the standard spellings and proper vowels and\nelimination of dialectal and idiosyncratic variations. In the interests\nof clarity, the example columns show script with vowel pointing from\nArabic to indicate the short vowels that are included alongside the\nunpointed form that will usually be encountered. However it should be\nnoted that the pronunciation of short vowels will vary.\n\nNote: it is recommended that a font such as Scheherazade, available\nfrom www.sil.org, which includes the Unicode extended Arabic sub-range,\nbe used to view this system.

It is not\nintended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is\nto provide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Kyrgyz that can then be linked\nto forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nGuljigit Kalykov (also seen as Guljigit Kalikov, Гульжигит Калыков). This convention is designed\nto ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Kyrgyz-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s\nnote may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings\nof names of well-known individuals.\n",

The table was published in volume\nII of the conference report.\nIn UN resolution XI/3 it is specifically stated that the\nsystem was recommended for the “romanization of the\ngeographical names within those Arabic-speaking countries\nwhere this system is officially adopted”. There is\nevidence of its partial implementation in Jordan, Oman and\nSaudi Arabia. The UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization\nSystems intends to continue monitoring the UN system’s\nimplementation across Arabic-speaking countries.\nIn some countries there exist local romanization schemes\nor practices. The geographical names of Algeria, Djibouti,\nMauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are generally rendered in\nthe traditional manner which conforms to the principles of\nthe French orthography.\nThe previous UN-approved system is still found in\nconsiderable international usage.\nArabic is written from right to left. The Arabic script\nusually omits vowel points and diacritical marks from\nwriting which makes it difficult to obtain uniform results\nin the romanization of Arabic. It is essential to identify\ncorrectly the words which appear in any particular name\nand to know the standard Arabic-script spelling including\nthe relevant vowels. One must also take into account\ndialectal and idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization\nis generally reversible though there may be some ambiguous\nletter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which may also point to\ncombinations of Arabic characters in addition to the\nrespective single characters.\n",

It is not intended to\neliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide\nan IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Tajik that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nParvona Jamshedov (also seen as Parvona Dzhamshedov, Парвона Ҷамшедов). This convention is\ndesigned to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Tajik-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak).\nA translator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

It is not\nintended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is\nto provide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Kazakh that can then be linked\nto forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nBekzat Sattarkhanov (also seen as Bekzat Sattarkanov, Бекзат Саттарханов). This convention is\ndesigned to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Kazakh-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s\nnote may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

A great effort has also been made to\nresearch and reflect common usage in the Pashto- speaking\nareas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to define rules\nwhich capture these trends to the best extent possible.\nHowever, a respect for the norms of usage has also been\nbalanced with the need for consistency and intelligibility.\nTherefore, there are cases where a less common spelling\nwill be the preferred usage under the guidance of this\nsystem. Lastly, specific names that cannot be incorporated\ngracefully into the rules described below are included with\ncase-by-case preferred spellings in a list near the end of\nthis document.\n",

The romanization system is compatible\nwith all dialects of Baluchi, including Eastern\nBaluchi, Western Baluchi, and Southern Baluchi.\n\nThe BGN/PCGN system laid out below includes diacritical\nmarks in order that the original script can be derived\nfrom the romanized form (i.e. it is reversible). For\ndesk users requiring a diacritic-free form, these\ndiacritics can simply be removed. In almost every case\nthe same basic Roman-script characters are kept as are\nused in the Hunterian system. The BGN/PCGN forms have\nfurther been designed to harmonize with the BGN/PCGN\nUrdu romanization system. In rigorous romanization\n(i.e. including diacritics), retroflexion is marked by\na sub-dot, and aspiration is marked by an apostrophe,\nwhere confusion with fricative digraphs could arise.\nFor letters used only in Arabic loan words, the\nrigorous forms have further been designed to harmonize\nwith the BGN/PCGN Persian romanization system.\n",
