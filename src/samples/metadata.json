      "description": "The BGN/PCGN 1958 System for the Persian alphabet was\nadopted by the BGN in 1946 and by the PCGN In 1958. It Is\nused for the romanization of standard geographic names in\nIran.\nThe Persian alphabet is the same as the Arabic alphabet\nexcept for the addition of four consonant symbols for\nsounds which do not occur in Arabic. Therefore, the same\nconversion values are used for the Persian alphabet as for\nthe Arabic alphabet wherever phonetically valid. Where\nletters common to the two alphabets have different\npronunciation in the two languages, conversion values\nreflecting the Persian pronunciation are provided in the\nPersian system.\nIt may be noted that neither the system of pointing nor the\nconversion values for vowels and diphthongs are the same\nfor Persian as for Arabic.\nPersian presents the same problems of vowel pointing as\nArabic in that the short vowel symbols necessary for the\nproper rendering of short vowels, long vowels, and\ndiphthongs are almost always omitted from written Persian.\nIt follows that, in order to produce transliter- tions in\nterms of standard written Persian, the transliterator must\nbe able to identify the words used in names and must know\ntheir standard written Persian spelling, their proper vowel\npointing, and how to eliminate pecularities due to\ndialectical variation.\nThe notes and special rules explain details of\ntransliteration not stated in the tables.\n",
      "notes": [
        "1)The Persian writing system, in its generally used form,\nemploys only the symbols found in Table I, and the alef maddeh\n(آ) of Table II. The symbols in column 1 of Table II are\ntraditional auxiliary symbols used by Persians only\nsporadically to indicate the exact reading of a given word.\nIn the case of i, ū, ey and ow, a choice of symbology\nexists, one system adhering to the Arabic tradition, the\nother being a modification of it. Likewise, there are two\nways of writing alef maq§ureh. The BGN/PCGN transliteration\nsystem presupposes forms fully pointed with the Persian\nsymbols represented in Table II, though these are omitted\nfrom the examples given below.\n",
        "2) Alef ( أ ) occurs with the following uses a. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or diphthong, and the alef itself is not transliterated, e.g., انجيرة Anjīreh, ايواني Eyvānī b. Initially with maddeh ( آ ),it indicates ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān. c. Medially and finally. it represents ā, e.g., e.g., آبادان Ābādān, توكا Tūkā. d.\tWith hamzeh. See Note 5.",
        "3) Where special considerations are paramount, the sub-dot may be used in place of the cedilla",
        "4) The two-letter symbols kh, zh, sh, and gh are convenient for use and easily comprehensible. The infrequent sequences of kāf, ze, sīn, and gāf followed by he can be unequivocally transliterated for bibliographical purposes by the use of a slant line (“shilling,” “solidus\") to separate true h from a preceding k, z, s, or\tg; that is,\tkh represents khe, but k/h stands for kāf followed by he.",
        "5) Hamzeh (ء)\tis\tnot regarded as a letter of the Persian alphabet, but as a diacritic mark, and as such is not always expressed in actual writing. In fully pointed words, however, it appears in several graphic forms, standing alone or written in conjunction with alef, vav, or ye (the ye in this instance being undotted). All these forms are transliterated simply with the apostrophe in the form resembling a small raised figure 9 (’)\t,e.g., جزء Joz’ صفراء şafrā’, مأخذ ma’khaz̄, مؤتمن mu’taman, پائين pā’īn Occasionally a word may appear pointed according to the strict Arabic tradition so as to indicate an initial hamzeh. This initial hamzeh is never transliterated, but only the vowel which it carries, e.g., •Jfi , whether pointed\tor\t0\t.\tis \"transliterated simply Anjireh.\t' Hamzeh is also sometimes written over final he or ye to represent the -ye form of the eg&feh, cf. Note 8.",
        "6) Alef maddeh is used initially to indicate ā, e.g., آبادان Ābādān Noninitially it indicates ’ā in words of Arabic origin, and must be so transliterated, e.g., قرآن Qor’ān, مآب ma’āb",
        "7) Tashdid ( ّ) indicates doubling of the consonant over which it is written and is represented in transliteration by writing the consonant twice, e.g محمّد Mohammad The sequence kasreh ye ye is transliterated īy.In names of Arabic origin containing the definite article, the vowel of the article is transliterated according to its Persian pronunciation and the lam, when followed by a “sun letter” (t, s̄, d, z̄, r, s, sh, ẕ, ţ, z̧, ţ, z̧, l, n) is assimilated. The article is written in lower case and separate from the preceding and following word, e.g., Zeyn od Din, but *£4 . Zeyn ed Dīn. Cf. Special Rule 1.",
        "8) The relational (ezafeh) suffix\tis\ttransliterated -e after final consonants (except for silent h). After silent h and after vowels, it is transliterated -ye. It is usually not expressed in Persian writing after a consonant (kasreh being understood), e.g., كوهِ مَرغٌوب Kuh-e Marghūb. After final alef or vav it is written with ye (ي), e.g., بايِ آب\tPa-ye Ab,\tجويِ آس Jū-ye Ās.\tAfter\tye (ي) and silent he it is written as hamzeh over the letter, e.g., دَهَانهٴ مَمبَر Dahāneh-ye Mambar, سَلَيٴ بُذٌرگ Salasi-ye Bozorrg.",
        "1.\tIn Persian names of Arabic origin, the word division used for transliterating Arabic will obtain, except that names ending in the word Allah will be written solid and the a of Allah will be replaced by o, e.g.,\tThe Arabic definite article when not subject to assimilation will be written al in name-initial position but usually, ol elsewhere, e.g., Al JJal but 2u ol Faqar. Cf. Note 7 above.",
        "2. In Persian names in general, in sequences of name elements pronounced as a single unit, division into separate words will be made after Persian letters written in the word final form. (But see the Rule immediately below.)",
        "3. The word abad which occurs very frequently at the end of place names will be written solid with the preceding word; e.g., Allahabad, not Allah Abad.",
        "4. Persian derivational endings such as vand and Turkish and other endings such as lar, li and lu will be written solid with the preceding word, whether so written in Persian script or not.",
        "5. The letter he, when used in Turkish fashion for word internal e, will be transliterated eh as usual but will be written solid with the remainder of the word.",
        "6. Kheplus vdv followed by long vowel or khe plus vdv followed by gammeh will be rendered khv although the v is not pronounced."

      "description": "Pashto is a language characterized by its variability. The\nchallenges of reaching a universally acceptable\ntransliteration standard for personal names are posed both\nby the dialect spread trending roughly from the southwest\nto the northeast parts of its geographic area, and also by\nthe competing influences of Dari and Urdu. Given the lack\nof any dominant standard on some points, it has been\nconsidered necessary to define a certain degree of\nflexibility within this standardization system in order to\nenable it to capture the variability of the language it\nseeks to reflect. A great effort has also been made to\nresearch and reflect common usage in the Pashto- speaking\nareas of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and to define rules\nwhich capture these trends to the best extent possible.\nHowever, a respect for the norms of usage has also been\nbalanced with the need for consistency and intelligibility.\nTherefore, there are cases where a less common spelling\nwill be the preferred usage under the guidance of this\nsystem. Lastly, specific names that cannot be incorporated\ngracefully into the rules described below are included with\ncase-by-case preferred spellings in a list near the end of\nthis document.\n",
      "notes": [
        "Pashto letter ge (‫ږ‬) The two common renderings for this letter are 'zh' and 'g.' 1 The preferred option will be 'zh' (consistent with the choice of southern 'sh' for ‫)ښ‬. However, when referring to communities that consistently render the name with a 'g' as opposed to a 'zh,' then 'g' will be the preferred option. In these cases, the inclusion of a variant spelling with 'zh' is strongly encouraged.",
        "Double consonants Double consonants represented by the tashdid (shaddah) are shown in most cases regardless of whether they are clearly enunciated in speech. Examples Muhammad Hassan, Izzatullah. However, consonants represented by digraphs are not doubled. Example Mubashir ( not Mubashshir). Special care should be taken when possible to discriminate between doubled and non-doubled letters in names that are otherwise indistinguishable in their transliterated forms Hasan (حسن (vs. Hassan (حسان(",
        "Digraphs No distinction is made between digraphs such as 'sh' and single contiguous letters such as 's' followed by 'h.'",
        "Short vowels zair and pesh The preferred options for the short vowels represented by the zair and pesh will be 'i' and 'u.' However, in cases where there is a mixed Dari and Pashto environment, then the use of 'e' and 'o' is accepted in consideration of Dari norms.",
        "Long/short vowels Long and short vowels are not distinguished in the system (with the exception of certain spellings driven by Dari influence as discussed above). In this and other systems, the borrowed Arabic name Salim could represent two distinct names, one with a long /a/ (Saalim - ‫)سالم and one with a long /i/ (Saliim - ‫)سلیم‬. This is known as a collision. This and many other prevailing standardization systems do not distinguish between these types of collisions. However, in cases like these, it is recommended that a vigorous effort be made to include variant spellings in order to eliminate ambiguity as to which name is intended, as in the following examples Hamid (var. Hameed) – ‫حمید‬ Hamid (var. Hamed) – ‫حامد‬",
        "Izafat The linking vowel of Persian origin known as the izafat will be written with a hyphen and then 'e' and then a following space. Example Koh-e Nur (\"mountain of light\"). There will be no special accommodation for when the initial word ends in a vowel.",
        "The Arabic article al ( ‫ال‬ ) The Arabic article will be written with a lowercase 'a' and followed by a hyphen, with the obvious exception that an uppercase 'a' should be used where required by English orthographic conventions, e.g., at the beginning of a sentence. Example Karim al-Afghani",
        "Genitive constructions Multi-part Arabic names that follow the Arabic genitive construction will be written with a lowercase ul joined to the last part of the name by a hyphen. Arabic sun letter assimilation generally will not be shown.",
        "In deference to widespread usage, the name Abd will be combined with the genitive article ul, and the rest of the name will be written separately ( specifically, one of the ninety-nine \"names of God\"). Examples Abdul Haq, Abdul Rahman",
        "Names incorporating \"--ullah\" will be written as a single unit. Examples Abdullah, Rahmatullah",
        "Names incorporating \"--din\" will be written as a single unit with sun letter assimilation shown, causing ul to change to ud. This type of name is the only case in which sun letter assimilation will be shown. Examples Jamaluddin, Shamsuddin",
        "Note, no effort will be made to force names into the genitive construction if they are not linked by the article. For example, both names Fazl ul- Rahman and Fazl Rahman would be acceptable, depending on whether the article was included in the individual's name.",
        "Consonant clusters Traditional Arabic names ending in a final consonant cluster will be spelled with the consonant cluster intact. Although most native Pashto speakers will break up the cluster in conversational speech, general usage in the written transliteration of names still favors the preservation of the consonant cluster in print. This type of name should not be confused with Arabic names whose orthography includes a zabar (short 'a' vowel) prior to the final consonant. -- NOT DONE",
        "TODO",
        "The unwritten phonetic \"glides,\" also known as semi- consonants (sounding similar to /y/ and /w/), will generally not be shown between two vowels. Examples Rauf, Said (سعيد)",
        "Care should be taken to distinguish the above rule from cases in which wao or ya are a written part of the name and function as true consonants, including cases where they are doubled. Examples Fayiz ( ‫فایز‬ ), Fayyaz ( ‫فیّاض‬ )",
        "A common form where ya will be shown in its role as a consonant is with the Arabic nisba (suffix showing origin, relation, etc.) appended to names that end in a vowel. Examples Ziayi, Shafiyi, Mirzayi, Paktiayi",
        "TODO In spite of best intentions, the unbending application of rules in any transliteration system is likely to produce some forms that fly in the face of accepted use. Therefore, the following names will be spelled as follows, in spite of minor variance with the rules described above. Aurangzeb (not Awrangzeb) Eid (not Id) Faizad (not Faizzad) Javed (not Jawed) 2 Parvez (not Parwez) Qureshi (not Quraishi) Saad (not Sad) Sherpao (not Sherpaw)",
        "The following names do not constitute exceptions to the rules of this standard, but they are names that pose significant challenges to standardization and are therefore listed here to ensure consensus Bahadur (not Bahadar, Bahader) Feroz (not Firoz, Fairuz, etc.) Firdaws (not Firdos) Husain (not Hussain) Isfandyar (not Asfandyar) Ismail (not Ismael) Khushhal (not Khushal) Niamat (not Nimat) Numan (not Nauman) Raza (not Reza) Sherzad (not Shirzad) Tor Jan (not Tur Jan) Uwais (not Awais)",
        "We treat the spelling of commonly used titles differently from the handling of names, given that titles are subject to norms of English as they are accepted into the English language.

Rather, it is\nto provide an IC standard Romanized (English)\ntransliteration from Persian (Farsi) and Dari that\ncan then be linked to forensic information in ways that\nwill help identify the referent of the\nname.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been\ntransliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the\nvariant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Perso-Arabic\nscript spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible,\nfollowing best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information\nsystem capabilities. This convention is\ndesigned to ensure that vital forensic information is not\nlost while maintaining consistency.\n\nFor names of individuals who are not part of the Persian-(\nFarsi) or Dari-speaking community,\nbut whose names are encountered in Farsi or Dari, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for\nnames from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak, Abu-\nMurtada). Spell names of individuals\nfrom languages that are written in Roman letters as they\nare spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the\nonline CIA World Factbook and the\nonline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of\nForeign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these online reference works should be used in\nplace of the IC Standard, with the IC\nStandard included as a variant in parentheses at the first\nusage. For any individual who has at one\ntime been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State\ndirectory but who no longer appears in those\nresources (i.e., is no longer a government official), the\nIC Standard spelling should appear first,\nwith the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in\nthose resources listed within parentheses\nat the first usage (e.g., former president Mahmud\nAhmadinezhad (Ahmadi-Nejad).\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized\ntranscription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system\nuses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe and hyphen.\nSome ambiguities in the Romanized\nform will occur without the use of diacritics. However,\nwithin the context of a report, where\nadditional information about the individual is provided,\nthe referent will be clearly identified.\nThis system will be used in conjunction with online tools,\nname dictionaries, and lists containing\nconventional spellings of names of well-known individuals.\n",

        "Hyphens: A hyphen will be used for compound\nlast names to connect major name elements (e.g., Raja’i-\nKhorasani, Tabataba’i-Shirazi, Soleimani-Meimandi).

It should be understood that when a full compound\nlast name is available, the second major element is\ntypically omitted for normal use, while the first major\nelement of the last name is preferred. It is thus\nrecommended as a best practice for reporting that both of\nthese names, if known, be included at the first instance,\nand only the family name be used thereafter in the report (\nunless it is known that a specific individual is commonly\nknown otherwise).

In international cartographic\nproducts mostly the BGN/PCGN 1967 system is used which differs from the\nformer mainly by using diacritical marks differently. Often the same\nspellings are used without any diacritical marks.\n\nAmharic uses the Ethiopic syllabic script whereby each syllable denotes a\ncombination of a consonant and a vowel. It has 34 basic characters, each\ncharacter having several different forms, usually called orders, according to\nthe vowel with which the basic character is combined.

      "description": "This system is the Intelligence Community (IC) standard for the transliteration of names\nfrom Hindi and Urdu that will be applied to all final written reports and products for IC\nconsumers. It is not intended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute\nforensic information. Rather, it is to provide an IC standard Romanized (English)\ntransliteration from standard Hindi and Urdu that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nThere are typically a number of ways that names can be Romanized from either\nDevanagari (Hindi) or modified Arabic (Urdu) scripts. Ambiguities can result from the\nRomanization of Hindi and Urdu names for several reasons, including the fact that some\nsounds in South Asian languages (e.g., retroflex consonants, voiced aspirates) have no\nequivalent in English or other European languages. In the case of Urdu, as in the original\nArabic source of many Islamic names, short vowel markings, double consonant marks\nand other diacritics that would clearly distinguish the name are almost always omitted\nfrom standard written texts. And many Islamic names of Arabic or Persian origin reflect\nspelling distinctions from those languages that are lost in modern Urdu pronunciation\n(e.g., three distinct Arabic letters all represent the identical sound [s] for Urdu speakers);\ntransliterations might either maintain those spelling distinctions or ignore them entirely.\nAnd, as in the Arabic source, names containing the Arabic definite article ‘al’ (‘ul’) show\nanticipatory assimilation in pronunciation (e.g., Shams al Din > Shamsuddin);\ntransliterations may either reflect spelling or pronunciation in such cases.\n\nBecause Hindi and Urdu overlap so extensively, it is desirable to correlate Hindi and\nUrdu transliterations as much as possible. In the area of names, this can become\nproblematic when the Urdu spelling accurately reflects original Arabic spelling while the\nHindi spelling was phonetically-based, in essence, already a transliteration. This would\nargue for ignoring Arabic/Urdu spelling distinctions not reflected in pronunciation in\neither Urdu or Hindi (e.g., letter sin versus letter sad) while maintaining Arabic/Urdu\nspelling distinctions like Hindi also maintains (e.g., qaf as in Qutubbin versus kaf)).\nHowever, this is not always possible (see Hindi va versus Urdu wau).\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated, that is to be indicated\n– as found – in parentheses immediately following its rendition in the transliteration\nstandard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (Mohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original\nDevanagari or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should also appear in\nparentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Hindi- or Urdu-speaking\ncommunity, use the relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language\n(e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of\nthe person. Spell names of individuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as\nthey are spelled in those languages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges\nPompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and\nthe on-line directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments,\nthe spellings given in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC\nStandard. For any individual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of\nState directory but who no longer appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a\ngovernment official), the IC Standard spelling should appear first, with the spelling, if\nknown, as it previously appeared in those resources listed within parentheses at the first\nusage.\n\nThe primary goal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of the\nname that is readable to the non-specialist.

Rather, it is to provide an\nIC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Uzbek that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first\nusage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should also\nappear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nFarkhod Tojiev (also seen as Farhod Tadjiyev, Фарход Тожиев). This convention is designed to\nensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Uzbek-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s\nnote may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g., George\nClooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any\nindividual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no\nlonger appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those\nresources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use\nof diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

      "description": "The following is the BGN/PCGN-approved romanization\nsystem for deriving standard spellings of Baluchi\ngeographic names. The romanization system is based on\nthe Hunterian system of romanization, which has been\nused by the Surveys of India and Pakistan for\nromanizing Baluchi geographic names for more than one\nhundred years. The romanization system is compatible\nwith all dialects of Baluchi, including Eastern\nBaluchi, Western Baluchi, and Southern Baluchi.\n\nThe BGN/PCGN system laid out below includes diacritical\nmarks in order that the original script can be derived\nfrom the romanized form (i.e. it is reversible). For\ndesk users requiring a diacritic-free form, these\ndiacritics can simply be removed. In almost every case\nthe same basic Roman-script characters are kept as are\nused in the Hunterian system. The BGN/PCGN forms have\nfurther been designed to harmonize with the BGN/PCGN\nUrdu romanization system. In rigorous romanization\n(i.e. including diacritics), retroflexion is marked by\na sub-dot, and aspiration is marked by an apostrophe,\nwhere confusion with fricative digraphs could arise.\nFor letters used only in Arabic loan words, the\nrigorous forms have further been designed to harmonize\nwith the BGN/PCGN Persian romanization system.\n",

        "Occasionally, sequences of /z/ or /s/ plus /h/ may be encountered, i.e. z·h, s·h. These may be romanized with the Unicode 'center dot' (U+00B7) separating the two letters, to distinguish them from the digraphs /zh/ and /sh/.",
        "The character ة is found very rarely in Baluchi, principally in certain Arabic religious terms, e.g. zakāt ('alms'). It should be romanized t.",
        "When the letters ال are found, representing the Arabic definite article, the ل is assimilated to a following 'sun letter' ,د ,ث ,ت ل ,ظ ,ط , ض , ,ص ,ش ,س , ,ر ,ذ or ن and is romanized t, , d, , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ ţ z , l, n accordingly.",
        "In romanization, the suffixes ءَ (-ā, singular definite) and ءِ (-ay, possessive) are connected to the previous word by a hyphen, though they are usually written separately.",
        "The word for 'and', written as و or ءُ, should be romanized as –u-, linked by hyphens to the two words it connects; e.g., ہ ٹد و س ٹد → Sind-u-Hind ('The Gangetic Plain').",
        "Except as specified in notes 4 and 5, word division in romanization should follow word division in the Baluchi script.",
        "Note that the short vowels in the Baluchi examples are not pointed.",
        "Certain initial, medial and final characters are not readily available in a Unicode-encoded font in a standalone form.",

It is not intended to eliminate variations\nof a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide an IC standard Romanized\n(English) transliteration from Russian that can then be linked to forensic information in ways that will\nhelp identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first usage. E.g.,\nSergey Nikolayevich Tyurin (Serguei Nicolaivitch Tiourine). In addition, if the original Cyrillic spelling\nis known, that spelling should also appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best\npractices of the issuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor non-Russian names, use the relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language. A\ntranslator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g., George Clooney,\nJorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-line\ndirectory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given in these\non-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual who has at one\ntime been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer appears in those resources\n(i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling should appear first, with the spelling, if\nknown, as it previously appeared in those resources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically readable\nto the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard (English) Roman\nalphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of diacritics. However,\nwithin the context of a report, where additional information about the individual is provided, the referent\nwill be clearly identified. This system will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries,\nand lists containing conventional spellings of names of well-known individuals.\n",

      "description": "This system is the Intelligence Community (IC) standard for the transliteration of Chechen names\nthat will be applied to all final written reports and products for IC consumers. It is not intended to\neliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide an\nIC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Chechen that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first\nusage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example: Ilyas\nAkhmadkant (also seen as Ilyas Axmadkhant, Ильяс Ахмадкӏант). This convention is designed\nto ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Chechen-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A\ntranslator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the online\ndirectory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any\nindividual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no\nlonger appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those\nresources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will\noccur without the use of diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional\ninformation about the individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system\nwill be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing\nconventional spellings of names of well-known individuals.\n",

      "description": "This part of ISO 233 is one of a series of International\nStandards, dealing with the conversion of systems of\nwriting. The aim of this part of ISO 233 and others in the\nseries is to provide a means for international\ncommunication of written messages in a form which permits\nthe automatic transmission and reconstitution of these, by\nmen or machines. The system of conversion, in this case,\nmust be univocal and entirely reversible. This means that\nno consideration should be given to phonetic and aesthetic\nmatters or to certain national customs: all these\nconsiderations are, indeed, ignored by the machine\nperforming the function. The adoption of this part of ISO\n233 for international communication leaves every country\nfree to adopt for its own use a national standard which may\nbe different, on condition that it is compatible with this\npart of ISO 233. The system proposed herein should make\nthis possible and be acceptable to international use if the\ngraphisms it creates are such that they may be converted\nautomatically into the graphisms used in any strict\nnational systems. This part of ISO 233 may be used by\nanyone who has a clear understanding of the system and is\ncertain that it can be applied without ambiguity. The\nresult obtained will not give a correct pronunciation of\nthe original text in a person’s own language, but it will\nserve as a means of finding automatically the original\ngraphism and thus allow anyone who has knowledge of the\noriginal language to pronounce it correctly. Similarly, one\ncan only pronounce correctly a text written in, for\nexample, English or Polish, if one has a knowledge of\nEnglish or Polish. The adoption of national standards\ncompatible with this part of ISO 233 will permit the\nrepresentation, in an international publication, of the\nmorphemes of each language according to the customs of the\ncountry where it is spoken. It will be possible to simplify\nthis representation in order to take into account the\nnumber of the character sets available on different kinds\nof machines.\n1-Scope:\nThis part of ISO 233 establishes a simplified\nsystem for the transliteration of Persian characters into\nLatin characters. This simplification of the stringent\nrules established by ISO 233:1984 is especially intended to\nfacilitate the processing of bibliographic information (\ne.g. catalogues, indices, citations, etc.)\n2-Normative references:\nThe following normative documents contain\nprovisions which, though reference in this text, constitute\nprovisions of this part of ISO 233.

It follows that for correct identification of the words which appear in any particular name, knowledge of its standard Arabic-script spelling including proper pointing, and recognition of dialectal and idiosyncratic deviations are essential.\n\nIn order to bring about uniformity in the Roman-script spelling of geographical names in Arabic-language areas, the system is based insofar as possible on fully pointed Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). In the interest of clarity, vowel pointing to indicate short vowels has been applied to the examples given below, and examples of the, more usual, unpointed script have also been provided; it should also be noted that the dots which occur on some characters of the Arabic script are not vowels but rather are an integral part of the base consonant.\n\nArabic script is written from right to left, and does not make a distinction between upper and lower case.\n",
      "notes": "\n- (NOTE 1) The symbol ◌ is used in this system to symbolise any Arabic consonant character. It is not itself an Arabic letter.\n\n- (NOTE 2) Hamzah (ء) is written in Arabic in association with most instances of initial alif, except those which belong to the definite article al or which bear a maddah (see note 9). Hamzah is written above the alif ( أَ) if the accompanying short vowel is a fatḩah or ḑammah and usually below the alif( أ ) if the accompanying short vowel is a kasrah.\n  When the purpose is to indicate the presence of a glottal stop, hamzah is written over medial alif ( أ ), wāw (ؤ) and yā’, typically without dots (ئ); or following final alif ( أ ء ), these characters serving only to “bear” the hamzah. Hamzah following kasrah ( ) is written (ئ); the yā’ is usually in the initial or medial form and the dots are omitted e.g. bi’r ( بئ ر ).\n  Hamzah following ḑammah ( ) is written (ؤ). Hamzah following a long vowel is written without a bearer and is positioned on the line of print like a regular character, e.g. صنعاء Şan‘ā’. The romanization of hamzah (’ - Unicode encoding 2019) should always be carefully distinguished from that of ‘ayn (‘ - Unicode encoding 2018).\n\n- (NOTE 3) Alif (ا) occurs with the following uses\n  a. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or diphthong; the alif itself is not romanized, but rather “carries” the short vowel, which is romanized; e.g., ظب ي أبو → Abū Z̧aby.\n\n  b. With maddah (آ – row 18 in the vowel table), it is represented ā; e.g., مُ عيط آلب و → Ālbū Mu‘ayţ. See also note 9.\n\n  c. Medially and finally it is represented ā; e.g., ب ا ب → Bāb, صيدا → Şaydā.\n\n  d. Medially and finally, alif may serve as the bearer of hamzah, e.g. رأس → ra’s. See also note 2.\n\n- (NOTE 4) The tā’ marbūţah character (ة), which looks like hā’ with two dots above and occurs only at the end of words, is romanized h, except in an iḑāfah noun phrase construction, where it is romanized t, in accordance with pronunciation. e.g. Muḩāfaz̧ah (as an isolated word) but Muḩāfaz̧at Baghdād. In exceptional cases, when it is necessary to distinguish it from the tā’ marbūţah, the ending fatḩah + hā’ ( ه ) may be romanized a·h when the character hā’ (ه) is pronounced as such. Example Muntaza·h. (see also special rule 13). The tā marbūţah is always preceded by the short vowel fatḩah ( ) and is therefore romanized as ah or at, except when it is preceded by alif when it is romanized āh (not āah), e.g. Ḩamāh (حماة ), and as āt within an iḑāfah construction.\n\n- (NOTE 5) The character yā’ (in final form but without dots) preceded by the vowel point fatḩah is known as alif maqşūrah. This character may also be pointed ى and should be romanized á. See character 7 in the vowel table.\n\n- (NOTE 6) The classical Arabic grammatical endings written with the nunation symbols (tanwīn) may be romanized, when necessary, by an, in, un. In modern spoken Arabic, these endings have become silent and should not be romanized e.g. classical alifun; modern alif.\n\n- (NOTE 7) Doubled consonant sounds are represented in Arabic script by placing a shaddah ( ) over a consonant character, although like the short vowels the shaddah may not always be written. In romanization the letter should be doubled, e.g. Quwwah, ‘Abbās. However, the combination of the consonant character yā’ with a shaddah preceded by a kasrah ( ي ) at the end of a word is romanized ī, e.g. Gharbī; a word ending kasrah + yā’ with a shaddah + tā’ marbūţah is romanized īyah (rather than iyyah), e.g. ال س ل يمانِ ية\nis romanized As Sulaymānīyah and not As Sulaymāniyyah; and when the kasrah + yā’ + shaddah combination is followed by the sound masculine plural ending ( يين or يون ) it should be romanized as –īyīn/īyūn, e.g. ساحة العباسيين should be romanized as Sāḩat al ‘Abbāsīyīn.\n\n- (NOTE 8) Hamzat al waşl (ٱ), which is utilized only in the pointing of classical Arabic, is romanized ’ as illustrated in the classical form of its name hamzatu’l waşli.\n\n- (NOTE 9) Since maddah ( أ ), which is placed over alif ( أ ), often occurs in word-initial position, no confusion results from the use of ā for alif maddah ( أ ) as well as for fatḩah followed by alif ( اَ ).\n\n- (NOTE 10) The ligature ل ا represents lām-alif, and should be romanized lā.\n\n- (NOTE 11) In word initial position the combination Alif +Wāw (او ) is sometimes used to render an initial long vowel sound in words of non-Arabic origin. Where this is clearly the case it should be romanized Ū. In words of Arabic or uncertain origin it should be romanized Aw. In word-medial or word-final position it should always be romanized āw. Similarly the combination Alif +Yā’ (اي ) is romanized Ī to render an initial long vowel sound but as āy in word-medial or word-final position.\n\n# SPECIAL RULES\n\n- The Arabic definite article al (ال ) should be treated as follows |\n  a. Initial definite articles should be capitalized and hyphens should not be used to connect parts of names, e.g. Ash Shāriqah. When appearing medially in a name the initial ‘a’ should be lower case, e.g. Tall al Laḩm.\n\n  b. When the definite article precedes a word beginning with one of the “sun letters” t, th, d, dh, r, z, s, sh, ş, ḑ, ţ, z̧, l, or n – the l is assimilated in pronunciation and romanization, thus yielding, for example, the romanization Ar Riyāḑ, rather than Al Riyāḑ for ال ريا ض .\n\n  c. If sources contradict over the inclusion or non-inclusion of the definite article in a name, preference should be given to the form with the article.\n\n- Conjunctions and prepositions should be romanized according to their written form in Arabic script and should be lower case. In cases where the conjunction or preposition ends in a long or short vowel any assimilated pronunciation should not be shown in the romanized form. e.g. Khabb wa ash Sha‘f (خب والشعف ). |\n\n  There are two exceptions to this rule\n\n  a. In the case of the preposition li (ل), where the alif of the definite article is assimilated in the written form as well as pronunciation, the written form should be shown in romanization as follows Mişr liţ Ţayarān (مصر للطيران ); Ash Sharikah al ‘Āmmah lil Maghāzil (الشركة العامة للمغازل ).\n\n  b. In the case of the preposition bi (ب), the alif of the definite article is assimilated in pronunciation and, although the alif remains in the written form the short vowel it carries changes from ‘a’ to ‘i’. For example Al Qaryah bid Duwayr (القرية بالدوير ) but Ad Duwayr (الدوير ); and Al Ḩarajah bil Qur’ān (الحرجة بالقرآن ) but Al Qur’ān (القرآن ).\n\n\n- The Arabic word for God ( لله) should be written Allāh. The alif khanjarīyah (dagger alif) ( ) above the second ل (lām) in the word لله , like the short vowels, is not usually written but should be romanized ā, like a full-size alif. This diacritical mark appears in a few other Arabic words, for instance on the alif maqşūrah as described in note 5.\n\n- Names which consist of noun phrases (see also note 4) should be written as separate words. The definite article within such names should be romanized al, not ul, e.g., ‘Abd Allāh, ‘Abd ar Raḩmān, Dhū al Faqār, and as noted in special rule 1, the medial al should be lower case.\n\n- The Arabic word ب ن should be romanized Bin rather than Ibn whenever written without alif, that is between two proper nouns, e.g., ‘Umar Bin al Khaţţāb. Where it appears with alif ( )اب ن , it should be romanized Ibn.\n\n- The Turkish word Paşa should be romanized from Arabic script as Bāshā. The Turkish word Bey should be romanized as Bey in Egyptian names, no matter how it is written in Arabic-language sources, but in other Arabic areas it should be romanized as Bak where written بك and as Bayk when written بيك .\n\n- The modern colloquial word Sīdī (سيدي ) should be give precedence over the classical form Sayyidī. This does not preclude the spelling Sayyidī if the latter is indicated by the Arabic script or other evidence – for instance, if the yā’ is written with a shaddah ( ).\n\n- The colloquial word Bū should not be changed to the standard form Abū.\n\n- The colloquial word for water, written مي ة on Arabic maps, should be romanized Mayyat.\n\n- Place names of Aramaic origin in Syria often contain initial consonant clusters consisting of b plus another consonant such as l or h. In romanization, the clusters bl, bh, etc., should be so represented.\n\n- In names containing the Arabic word for back, ridge, or hill, appearing as either ظهر (Z̧ahr) or ضه ر (Ḑahr) in Arabic sources, the word should be romanized to reflect the particular Arabic spelling shown. Where sources differ, preference should be given to the form found on the most authoritative source.\n\n- In formal Arabic, the spelling of some words ending in a long vowel character may change according to that word’s grammatical function in a sentence. For example, the personal name Abū Bakr (ابو بكر ) would become Abī Bakr (ابي بكر ) when preceded by a generic in an iḑāfah construction (used in Moroccan Arabic Script) e.g. Shāri‘ Abī Bakr (شارع ابي بكر – Abu Bakr Street). The spelling of such words as found on the most authoritative source should be used in the romanized form of the name. Other common words affected by this rule are Banū/Banī (sons of…) and Dhū/Dhī (owner of ...). Examples of names in this category include Jabal Abā aş Şabbān (جبل ابا الصبان ) and Muḩāfaz̧at Dhī Qār ( محافظة ذي قار ).\n\n- Occasionally the character sequences ك ه , ده , س ه , and ت occur. They may be romanized k·h, d·h, s·h, and t·h in order to differentiate these romanizations from the digraphs kh, dh, sh, and th, which are used to represent the characters خ, ذ, ش, and ث respectively. See also note 4.\n"

It is not\nintended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is\nto provide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Kyrgyz that can then be linked\nto forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nGuljigit Kalykov (also seen as Guljigit Kalikov, Гульжигит Калыков). This convention is designed\nto ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Kyrgyz-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s\nnote may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings\nof names of well-known individuals.\n",

      "description": "This romanization system agreed by BGN and PCGN in November 2007,\naccommodates the linguistic complexity of Afghanistan as manifest in\nits geographical names.\n\nThe following tabulation shows the original Perso-Arabic script with\naccompanying Unicode value (columns 1a and b), the Yaghoubi\nromanization (column 2), the BGN/PCGN romanization with accompanying\nUnicode value (columns 3a and b), an English phonetic example (column\n4), and an example toponym (columns 5b and c).\n\n[The Yaghoubi romanization system was developed in 1959 by\nMuzaffarud Din Yaqubi (commonly seen as Yaghoubi). It is a native\nofficial system designed to reflect Afghan names, both Dari and Pashto,\nand both pronunciation and genuine linguistic truth.]\n\nThe tables function as both a romanization system for Afghanistan (i.e.\nwith access to the original script, these tables can be applied to get\na standardized Roman result - moving from columns 1 to 3) and as a\nmeans of converting the available Yaghoubi Roman-script spellings, as\nappear on the Fairchild Aerial Surveys map series, to standard BGN/PCGN\nspellings (moving from columns 2 to 3).\n\nThe points used in Arabic to mark short vowels and certain other\ndiacritical marks are infrequently written in Afghanistan.\nConsequently, a reference source may sometimes be required to aid\ncorrect identification of the standard spellings and proper vowels and\nelimination of dialectal and idiosyncratic variations. In the interests\nof clarity, the example columns show script with vowel pointing from\nArabic to indicate the short vowels that are included alongside the\nunpointed form that will usually be encountered. However it should be\nnoted that the pronunciation of short vowels will vary.\n\nNote: it is recommended that a font such as Scheherazade, available\nfrom www.sil.org, which includes the Unicode extended Arabic sub-range,\nbe used to view this system. [Please note that the identification of a\nparticular font does not represent an endorsement of any specific\nproduct or manufacturer.]\n",
      "notes": [
        "Alif (ا) should be romanized as follows:\n\na. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or\n  diphthong; the alif itself is not romanized, but rather the short vowel\n  it “carries” is romanized; e.g., ميړ أَسَلم ژرَندَه → Mī Aslam Zhrandah\nb. When it carries a maddah (آ) (see vowel table, row 6), it represents ā; e.g., آب بَند → Āb Band.\nc. Medially and finally it represents ā (see vowel table, row 5); e.g., ماڼۍ → Māṉêy\nd. Medially and finally in words of Arabic origin, alif may serve as the bearer of hamzah, e.g. رأس → ra’s.\n",
        "Occasionally the letter sequences سه ,زه ,که, and گه occur without intervening vowels. They may be romanized k·h, z·h, s·h, and g·h in order to differentiate these romanizations from the digraphs kh, zh, sh, and gh, which are used to represent the letters ش ,ژ ,خ, and غ. Additionally, the Pashto letters څ and ځ, routinely romanized ts and dz, may be alternatively romanized s and z تس when for special reasons it is desired that confusion be avoided with the character sequences (ts) and دز (dz), respectively.",
        "The vagaries of written Afghan languages, as pertains to spacing and word division, are addressed as follows: Spaces may be added to or subtracted from Afghan words written in Arabic script, for the purposes of standardization. This is particularly relevant when the words are hand-written, are rendered “art st cally”, or express other s ch non-standard flourishes, as long as the sense of the toponym, word, or phrase is not compromised. Romanized toponyms are typically divided into constituent words (spaces and other grammatical rules applied) when those words can stand independently, for purposes of standardization and minimization of confusion, particularly in situations where Afghan writers are inconsistent in their application of spacing and word breaks. When the Afghan word or suffix is only used in combination with other nouns or adjectives, then it should be appended to the preceding word in its romanization. This includes (but is not limited to) - ābā , -zaī, -zā ah, - ū, -wand, -gaī, -kaī, -pūr, - ēsh, -lar, -lī, -lū and ullāh, as, for example, seen in Raḩmatābād (رحمت آباد) and Raḩmatullāh (رحمت االله), but Raḩmat Khēl (رحمتخيل) and Raḩmat Shahr (رحمتشهر).",
        "The one-letter words د (Pashto) and و (Dari) are romanized dê and wa, respectively.",
        "The word الله, meaning God, should always be romanized Allāh, except as specified in note 3. Note that the Unicode value FDF2 spells Allāh, but omits the alif in some common fonts, including Times New Roman. If in doubt, try in Arial Unicode MS to verify. Also note that the “dagger al f” ( ) above the second ل (lām) n the ord الله, is not written but should be romanized ā, like a full-size alif.",
        "In names of Arabic origin, the l of the definite article al s ass m lated before the ‘s n letters’ , , , , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ, , z, l and n. In its romanization, the article should be separated from the name it precedes and should not be capitalized except at the beginning of a name, e.g. جبل السراج→ Jabal as Sarāj",
        "In Arabic names, a shaddah, ّ is used to denote the doubling of a particular consonant character, e.g. ُم َح َمد → Muḩammad. Ho ever, n Pashto th s ‘do bl ng’ s freq ently om tted n both Perso- Arabic script and the resulting romanization. Guidance on doubling may be taken from an authoritative names source, such as an Afghan government source or Pashto dictionary; for example, it is usual to see Ḩājī without and ‘Abbās with the doubled consonant. The doubled y consonant is almost always retained, as in Sayyid or Qayyūm.",
        "In Afghan names which contain an iẕāfah, it should be romanized as -e or –ye according to common pronunciation, but generally, -e is used if the preceding word ends with a consonant other than silent heh, and -ye if the preceding word ends with a vowel sound e.g. غر ِحصار → Ghar-e ِ Ḩ şār; َقل َع ٔه َنو → Qal‘ah-ye Now. Scholarly sources indicate that heh is silent in darah and qal‘ah (thus darah-ye, qal‘ah-ye), but lightly spoken in kōh and chāh (thus kōh-e, chāh-e).",
        "The character sequence خو, where followed by ا or ی should be romanized khwā or khwī, although the w is either not pronounced, or only weakly so, as in خواجه → khwājah.",
        "Plural nouns ending in -hā or -ān should always be romanized as a single word, regardless of whether a space appears in a Perso-Arabic script source.",
        "Unicode values listed in the tables above are required to ensure standardization and to minimize confusion from competing representations of a given character. It should be noted that the Persian Unicode value 0643 or FEDA( ك Unicode value 06A9) is recommended rather than the Arabic( ک or FED9), the Persian گ (Unicode value 06AF) is recommended rather than ګ (Unicode value 06AB) or ڰ (Unicode value 06B0) or ك (Unicode value 0643 or FEDA or FED9), and the Pashto character ځ (Unicode value 0681) is recommended rather than the heh with a dot above and a dot below (no Unicode value). For the letter ی in its many variations, care must be exercised to follow this romanization guide's recommendations to eliminate confusion for search engines and software. BGN/PCGN does not use the Unicode encoding FEEF for the character ی in any Afghan word.",

The\nromanization system presented here may be applied to all\nPashto geographical names. Although the BGN/PCGN policy for\ngeographical names in Afghanistan is to apply the BGN/PCGN\nnational system of romanization for Afghanistan (2007),\nwhich incorporates Dari elements, when applied to a Pashto\ngeographical name, the romanized results of the BGN/PCGN\nnational system for Afghanistan are the same as those of\nthis Pashto romanization system1 . The Pashto alphabet uses\na modified form of the Perso-Arabic script, and contains\ntwelve additional consonants not present in standard\nArabic, as well as three additional vowel characters and an\nadditional vowel point. ڼ گ ښ ژ ږ ړ ډ ځ څ چ ټ پ :Consonants\nٙ :Point Vowel; ې ۍ ى :Vowels The points used in Arabic to\nmark short vowels and certain other diacritical marks are\nnot written in Pashto. Consequently, a reference source may\nsometimes be required to aid correct identification of the\nstandard spellings and proper vowels and elimination of\ndialectal and idiosyncratic variations. In the interests of\nclarity, a column showing vowel pointing from Arabic to\nindicate short vowels has been included in the examples\nbelow, alongside the unpointed form that will usually be\nencountered. However it should be noted that the\npronunciation of short vowels will vary. (Note: it is\nrecommended that a font such as Scheherazade, available\nfrom www.sil.org, which includes the Unicode extended\nArabic sub-range, be used to view this system2 .)\n",
      "notes": [
        "1. Alif ( ‫ا‬ ) should be romanized as follows a. Initially,it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or diphthong; the alif itself is not romanized, but rather the short vowel it “carries” is romanized; e.g., Aslam Zhrandah ‫ه‬ َ‫د‬ ‫ن‬ ‫ژر‬ ‫سلَم‬ َ‫أ‬ ‫ميړ‬ → b. When it carries a maddah (‫)آ‬ (see vowel table, row 3), it represents ā; e.g., Band. Mīṟ ‫د‬ ‫ن‬ ‫ب‬ َ ‫آب‬ → Āb c. Medially and finally it represents ā (see table 2, row 2); e.g., ‫ۍ‬ ‫ماڼ‬ → Māṉêy d. Medially and finally in words of Arabic origin, alif may serve as the bearer of hamzah, e.g. ‫رأس‬ → ra’s. See also note 4.",
        "2. The characters tsē ( ‫څ‬ ) and dzē ( ‫ځ‬ ) may be romanized t͡ s and d͡ z (the combining double breve ( Unicode 0361) appearing over the digraph) when for special reasons it is desired that confusion be avoided between ‫ت‬ (t) plus ‫س‬ (s) and between ‫د‬ (d) plus ‫ز‬ (z), respectively.",
        "3. Occasionally the character sequences ‫ه‬ ‫ك‬ , ‫ه‬ ‫ز‬ , ‫ه‬ ‫س‬ , and ‫ه‬ ‫گ‬ occur . They may be romanized k·h, z· h, s·h, and g·h in order to differentiate these romanizations from the digraphs kh, zh, sh, and gh, which are used to represent the characters ‫خ‬ , ‫ژ‬, ‫ش‬ , and ‫غ‬ respectively .",
        "4. Hamzah ( ‫ء‬ ) should be romanized as follows a. In word-initial position, where it will appear either above or below alif ( indicates a short vowel and should not itself be romanized. romanized by an apostrophe, e.g. ‫أ‬ or ‫إ‬ ), it In other positions it should be ‫جُزء‬ → juz’. b. Yeh with hamzah ( ‫ئ‬ ) should be romanized êy, unless it represents the compound (iẕāfah) morpheme, in which case it is romanized according to note 9 below.",
        "5. The division of words utilized in Pashto writing is followed in romanization, except that the elements –ābād, - khwā, -shahr, -zādah, -zay and -ullāh are always romanized as part of the preceding word, e.g. ‫آباد‬ ‫ت‬ ‫م‬ َ ْ‫ح‬ ‫ر‬ َ → Raḩmatābād and ‫الله‬ ‫ت‬ ‫م‬ َ ْ‫ح‬ ‫ر‬ َ → Raḩmatullāh. However, when the word for God ( ‫الله‬ ) appears as a standalone word it should be written Allāh. Note also the “dagger alif” ( ٙ) above the second ‫ل‬ (lām) in the word ‫الله‬ ; this, like the short vowels, is not written in Pashto but should be romanized ā, like a full- size alif. Persian derivational endings such as –vand and endings of Turkish origin such as –lar, -lī, -lū, -i, -u, - si, and –su, should be written together with the preceding word.",
        "6. The Pashto preposition ‫د‬ should be romanized dê in agreement with its pronunciation, despite the fact that it is sometimes pointed with kasrah ( ٙ ).",
        "7. In names of Arabic origin, the l of the definite article al/ul is assimilated before the ‘sun letters’ t, s̄ , d, z̄ , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ, ţ, z̧ , l and n. In romanization, the article will be written al or its assimilated equivalent in name-initial position but ul or its assimilated equivalent elsewhere; the article should be separated from the name it precedes and should not be capitalized, except at the beginning of a name, e.g. جَبَل السَرَاج → Jabal us Sarāj",
        "8. In Arabic names, a shaddah, ٙ is used to denote the doubling of a particular consonant character, e.g. ‫مَّد‬ َ‫ح‬ ‫م‬ ُ → Muḩammad. However, in Pashto this ‘doubling’ is frequently omitted in both Perso-Arabic script and the resulting romanization. Guidance on doubling may be taken from an authoritative names source, such as an Afghan government source or Pashto dictionary; for example, it is usual to see Ḩājī without and ‘Abbās with the doubled consonant. The doubled y consonant is almost always retained, as in Sayyid or Qayyūm",
        "9. The iẕāfah morpheme is not a grammatical feature of Pashto and, if encountered in a linguistically hybrid geographical name (i.e. combining features of both Pashto and Dari), it should be treated according to the BGN/PCGN national system of romanization for Afghanistan, 2007, as – e, unless the preceding word ends with a silent heh (‫)ه‬ or a vowel when it should be shown – ye, e.g. 10. The character sequence ‫خو‬ , ‫صار‬ ‫ح‬ ِ ‫غر‬ → Ghar-e Ḩişār; ‫و‬ ‫ن‬ َ ‫ه‬ ٔ ‫لع‬ َ ‫ق‬ َ → when followed by ‫ا‬ or ‫ی‬ , Qal‘ah-ye Now.",
        "10. The character sequence خو when followed by ‫ا‬ or ‫ی‬ ,should be romanized khw, although the w is either not pronounced, or only weakly pronounced; e.g. ‫خواجه‬ → khwājah.",

The table was published in volume\nII of the conference report.\nIn UN resolution XI/3 it is specifically stated that the\nsystem was recommended for the “romanization of the\ngeographical names within those Arabic-speaking countries\nwhere this system is officially adopted”. There is\nevidence of its partial implementation in Jordan, Oman and\nSaudi Arabia. The UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization\nSystems intends to continue monitoring the UN system’s\nimplementation across Arabic-speaking countries.\nIn some countries there exist local romanization schemes\nor practices. The geographical names of Algeria, Djibouti,\nMauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are generally rendered in\nthe traditional manner which conforms to the principles of\nthe French orthography.\nThe previous UN-approved system is still found in\nconsiderable international usage.\nArabic is written from right to left. The Arabic script\nusually omits vowel points and diacritical marks from\nwriting which makes it difficult to obtain uniform results\nin the romanization of Arabic. It is essential to identify\ncorrectly the words which appear in any particular name\nand to know the standard Arabic-script spelling including\nthe relevant vowels. One must also take into account\ndialectal and idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization\nis generally reversible though there may be some ambiguous\nletter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which may also point to\ncombinations of Arabic characters in addition to the\nrespective single characters.\n",

In order to make the transcription and phonetic\nmore accurate, the syllable structure can not be restricted by the\nsyllable form of Mandarin Chinese. Soundproof symbols can be used\nin various occasions that are easy to be confused. When recording,\nadditional symbols can be added to specific letters to represent\nspecial sounds.\n\nThe transliteration and transliteration of ethnic minority scripts\nin Latin script shall be based on the script. Letters with the same\nor similar pronunciation and usage as in the \"Hanyu Pinyin Plan\"\nshall be written according to them; different or dissimilar letters\nshall be transcribed separately. If the text does not use Latin\nletters, the corresponding Chinese phonetic letters shall be used\naccording to the pronunciation of the text. If there is no text,\naccording to the general voice mark.\n\nArticle 3\n\nSpecial place names are handled with reference to the following\nmethods:\n\n(1) If the commonly used Chinese name is partly transliterated and\npartly translated, the transliteration part is spelled according to\nthe transliteration method, and the free translation part is\nspelled according to the pronunciation of the Chinese character.\n\n(2) If the commonly used Chinese character translation is a section\ntranslation, the actual situation may be considered. Some are\ntransliterated according to the full name of the original name, and\nsome are spelled according to the Hanyu pronunciation of the\nsection translation.\n\n(3) If the translated name of a Chinese character originally came\nfrom a minority language, but later became a Chinese form and has\nbeen commonly used, it can be spelled according to the\npronunciation of the Chinese character, including the original name\ntransliterated if necessary.\n\n(4) Other special circumstances shall be dealt with according to\nspecific discretion.\n",

It is\nnot intended to eliminate variations of a name that can\ncontribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide\nan IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from\nmodern standard Arabic that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of\nthe name. Ambiguities can result from the Romanization of\nArabic names because the Arabic source generally omits\nshort vowel markings, double consonant marks, and other\ndiacritics that would clearly distinguish the name.\nLinguists use their experience with the language and aids\nsuch as on-line tools and name dictionaries to determine\nthe exact Arabic and the appropriate transliteration into\nthe Roman alphabet. In cases where an individual's name has\nalready been transliterated, that is to be indicated -- as\nfound -- in parentheses immediately following its rendition\nin the transliteration standard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (\nMohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original Arabic-\nscript spelling is known, that spelling should also appear\nin parentheses following the name, if possible, following\nbest practices of the issuing organization and taking into\nconsideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic\ninformation is not lost. For names of persons who are known\nto not be part of the Arabic-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that\nlanguage (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may\nbe used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell\nnames of individuals from languages that are written in\nRoman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou). In the\ncase of active senior government officials in the on-line\nCIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of\nState and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the\nspellings given in these on-line reference works should be\nused in place of the IC Standard. For any individual who\nhas at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of\nState directory but who no longer appears in those\nresources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, with the spelling,\nif known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage. The primary\ngoal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized\ntranscription of the name that is readable to the non-\nspecialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard (\nEnglish) Roman alphabet plus the apostrophe. Some\nambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the\nuse of diacritics. However, within the context of a report,\nwhere additional information about the individual is\nprovided, the referent will be clearly identified. This\nsystem will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name\ndictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings\nof names of well-known individuals.\n",
      "notes": "- Long/Short Vowels: Long and short vowels are not\ndistinguished in this system Samir (could be Saamir or\nSamiir in Arabic).\n\n- Double consonants: Double consonants represented by the\nArabic shaddah are shown in most cases (e.g., Hassan,\nMuhammad). Exceptions: ’ayn and consonants represented by\ndigraphs are not doubled (e.g., al-Qadhafi [not\nalQadhdhafi], Mubashir [not Mubashshir]).\n\n- Hamzah (glottal stop): The hamzah is represented by an\napostrophe (’). Note that this is the same symbol used to\nrepresent another consonant, the ’ayn.\n\n- Ta’ marbutah (feminine ending marker): On the construct\nform or when pronounced “t”, it is represented with a roman\nt. In all other cases, it is represented with an h.\n\n- Digraphs: No distinction is made between digraphs such as\nsh and single contiguous letters (e.g., s followed by h).\n\n- Definite article “al” (‘the’): Follows Arabic spelling\nrather than pronunciation. That is, sun letter assimilation\nis not shown in the Romanized form (e.g., ’Abd-alRahman,\nnot ’Abd-ar-Rahman).\n\n- Diphthongs: the second element of the diphthong is\n  represented by a y or a w (rather than an i or a u):\n  Haytham, Faysal, Tawfiq, Rawdah.\n\n- Hyphens: Hyphens (-) are used to connect name elements\n  within a name: ’Abd- al Rahman, Abu-al-Bashar, Bin-Ladin.\n  Exceptions: Names that incorporate “Allah” as part of the\n  name (e.g., ’Abdallah, Nasrallah), names marked by the\n  lineage/family marker “Al” (e.g., Al Thani) are not\n  hyphenated.\n\n- The definite article, “al”, within name phrases, is\n  Romanized as al and not as ul: Nur-al-Din (not Nur-ul-Din).\n  It is not capitalized when name-initial.\n\n- Names that incorporate Allah as part of the name retain the\n  a of Allah rather than a grammatical marker u: ’Abdallah (\n  not ’Abdullah).\n\n- Foreign names borrowed or appearing in Arabic are spelled\n  according to the standard Western tradition: Georges,\n  Michel. However, names of non-Arabic origin no longer\n  considered foreign by Arabic speakers follow the IC\n  conventions: Butrus (not Peter).\n\n- Prefix ‫بن‬ (bin ‘son of’) is Romanized Bin unless written\n  with an alif, in which case it is Romanized as Ibn. The\n  colloquial form Bu (‘father’) should not be standardized as\n  Abu. These prefixes are capitalized.\n\n- In general, Romanization follows the Modern Standard\n  Arabic (MSA) form rather than local pronunciation\n  standards. For example, the letter ‫ج‬ (jim) is represented\n  as a j even when pronounced as a “g” (e.g., Egyptian Gamal\n  is Romanized as Jamal).\n"

Rather, it is to provide an IC standard Romanized (English)\ntransliteration from standard Hindi and Urdu that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nThere are typically a number of ways that names can be Romanized from either\nDevanagari (Hindi) or modified Arabic (Urdu) scripts. Ambiguities can result from the\nRomanization of Hindi and Urdu names for several reasons, including the fact that some\nsounds in South Asian languages (e.g., retroflex consonants, voiced aspirates) have no\nequivalent in English or other European languages. In the case of Urdu, as in the original\nArabic source of many Islamic names, short vowel markings, double consonant marks\nand other diacritics that would clearly distinguish the name are almost always omitted\nfrom standard written texts. And many Islamic names of Arabic or Persian origin reflect\nspelling distinctions from those languages that are lost in modern Urdu pronunciation\n(e.g., three distinct Arabic letters all represent the identical sound [s] for Urdu speakers);\ntransliterations might either maintain those spelling distinctions or ignore them entirely.\nAnd, as in the Arabic source, names containing the Arabic definite article ‘al’ (‘ul’) show\nanticipatory assimilation in pronunciation (e.g., Shams al Din > Shamsuddin);\ntransliterations may either reflect spelling or pronunciation in such cases.\n\nBecause Hindi and Urdu overlap so extensively, it is desirable to correlate Hindi and\nUrdu transliterations as much as possible. In the area of names, this can become\nproblematic when the Urdu spelling accurately reflects original Arabic spelling while the\nHindi spelling was phonetically-based, in essence, already a transliteration. This would\nargue for ignoring Arabic/Urdu spelling distinctions not reflected in pronunciation in\neither Urdu or Hindi (e.g., letter sin versus letter sad) while maintaining Arabic/Urdu\nspelling distinctions like Hindi also maintains (e.g., qaf as in Qutubbin versus kaf)).\nHowever, this is not always possible (see Hindi va versus Urdu wau).\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated, that is to be indicated\n– as found – in parentheses immediately following its rendition in the transliteration\nstandard (e.g., Muhammad Khulud (Mohamed Khulood)). In addition, if the original\nDevanagari or Arabic-script spelling is known, that spelling should also appear in\nparentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. This\nconvention is designed to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Hindi- or Urdu-speaking\ncommunity, use the relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language\n(e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A translator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of\nthe person. Spell names of individuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as\nthey are spelled in those languages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges\nPompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and\nthe on-line directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments,\nthe spellings given in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC\nStandard. For any individual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of\nState directory but who no longer appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a\ngovernment official), the IC Standard spelling should appear first, with the spelling, if\nknown, as it previously appeared in those resources listed within parentheses at the first\nusage.\n\nThe primary goal of this system is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of the\nname that is readable to the non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without\nthe use of diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional\ninformation about the individual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified.\nAdditionally, this system will be used in conjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries\nand lists containing conventional spellings of names of well-known individuals\n",

This will require a good knowledge of the language in question."

It is not intended\nto eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide\nan IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Tatar that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nRustam Abdrashitov (also seen as Rustem Abdrashitov, Рустам Абдрашитов). This convention is\ndesigned to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Tatar-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s\nnote may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

It is not intended to\neliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is to provide\nan IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Tajik that can then be linked to forensic\ninformation in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nParvona Jamshedov (also seen as Parvona Dzhamshedov, Парвона Ҷамшедов). This convention is\ndesigned to ensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Tajik-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak).\nA translator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

It is not\nintended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it is\nto provide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Azeri that can then be linked\nto forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the\nfirst usage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should\nalso appear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the\nissuing organization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example:\nRashad Sadykhov (also seen as Rashad Sadigov, Рашад Садыхов). This convention is designed to\nensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Azeri-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A translator’s\nnote may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of individuals from\nlanguages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those languages (e.g.,\nGeorge Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the on-\nline directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings given\nin these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any individual\nwho has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no longer\nappears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard spelling\nshould appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those resources\nlisted within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use of\ndiacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

The tabulation\ncovers both major varieties of the Kurdish language: Kurmanji and\nSorani. Kurmanji is spoken principally in Turkey and in Iraq north of\nthe Great Zab River (Dahūk/Dihok Governorate). It is generally written\nin Roman script, and usually employs the Roman orthography. Sorani is\nspoken principally in Iraq south of the Great Zab river (Arbīl/Hewlêr\nand As Sulaymānīyah/Slêmanî governorates). It is generally written in\nPerso-Arabic script, and usually employs the Perso-Arabic script\northography.\n\nKurdish forms of geographical names in Turkey will usually be found\nin Roman script, and so no romanization process will be required. The\ndigraph options for consonant letters '\\u0686', '\\u0634', and '\\u063A'\nwill not be encountered for such names. In Iraq, Syria, and Iran,\nKurdish will usually be encountered in Perso-Arabic script, in which\ncase it should be romanized into the corresponding Roman script form.\nKurdish geographical names for places and features outside Turkey,\nfound in Roman script form, should, where necessary and if possible, be\ntailored to fit the orthography of the Romanization shown below and\nshould employ the digraph options for consonant letters '\\u0686',\n'\\u0634', and '\\u063A'.\n",

        "In pure Kurdish words hamza is borne by yā’ ( ئ ) and occurs only before initial vowels; it is not romanized. Medial and final hamza in Arabic borrowings are romanized by ’ (apostrophe – Unicode encoding 2019).",
        "The letters ث ذ ص ض ط ظ do not occur in pure Kurdish words. In Arabic borrowings some writers retain these letters, others substitute س ز س ز ت ز respectively. Only the letters ط ض and ص are catered for in the Library of Congress tabulation, as reflected in lines 16-18 of the above Consonant table. Words of obvious Arabic origin occurring in a Kurdish toponymic environment will be treated as Kurdish rather than Arabic, as will words of other non-Kurdish origins.",
        "The digraph options appearing in rows 6, 15 and 20 of the consonants table should be used for Kurdish geographical names in Iraq, Iran, and Syria. The single character options should be used for Kurdish geographical names in Turkey.",
        "ڨ is used to represent v in foreign words. Some southern Kurdish writers use it to represent the v in borrowings from northern Kurdish dialects. و is pronounced as a v in the north and as a w elsewhere.",
        "Hā’ can be used as a vowel or a consonant. The initial (ه) and medial (forms are used for the consonant h, Consonant table, row 31, while the final (ه) and independent (forms are used to represent the vowel e, Vowel table, row 1. Therefore, when used as a consonant, the final and independent forms of hā’ will be seen as ‘ه’ instead of ‘and ‘ه’, respectively. For example, مهه meh, (“month”). When used as ‘e’, the hā’ behaves like the letters alif (ا) , wāw, dāl (د) , and rā (ر) , in that it never joins to the following letter (i.e., it has no medial form). Consequently, the following letter will display the initial form, e.g. هەولێر Hewlêr (unless there is only one following letter, in which case it will be written in the independent form, e.g. ماوەت Mawet). As with other vowels (see special rules 2 and 3), initial e is preceded by the kursî hamza, yielding initial ئه , e.g. ئهني enî “forehead”.",
        "In pure Kurdish words, the vowel ى is always long î, e.g. كانى ماسێ Kanî Masê. When it represents îzafe, it is also romanized î and joined by means of a hyphen to its preceding word e.g. پارێزگاى دهۆك Parêzga-î Dihok.",

        "In the Perso-Arabic orthography for Kurdish, all vowels are written, with the exception of the short i, which is expressed with a kasrah under the preceding consonant (ِ). In Perso-Arabic script, the kasrah will rarely be written ( e.g., كرن kirin “to do”). Like all Kurdish vowels, the short i will be preceded by a kursî hamza )ئ )if it appears at the beginning of a word (see 3 below; see row 4 of vowel table).",

It\nis not intended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather,\nit is to provide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Serbian that can then be\nlinked to forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first\nusage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic spelling is known, that spelling should also appear in\nparentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing organization\nand taking into consideration information system capabilities. This convention is designed to\nensure that vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Serbian-speaking community, use the\nrelevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Mikhail, Yitzhak). A\ntranslator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any\nindividual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no\nlonger appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those\nresources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use\nof diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

      "description": "This system is the Intelligence Community standard for the transliteration of Bulgarian person\nnames that will be applied to all final written reports and products for IC consumers. This\nstandard matches both the Bulgarian national standard adopted in 2009 and the Board of\nGeographic Names / Permanent Committee on Geographic Names standard adopted in 2013. It is\nnot intended to eliminate variations of a name that can contribute forensic information. Rather, it\nis to provide an IC standard Romanized (English) transliteration from Bulgarian that can then be\nlinked to forensic information in ways that will help identify the referent of the name.\n\nIn cases where an individual’s name has already been transliterated in a variant spelling, the IC\nStandard spelling should appear first, followed by the variant spelling(s) in parentheses at the first\nusage. In addition, if the original Cyrillic-script spelling is known, that spelling should also\nappear in parentheses following the name, if possible, following best practices of the issuing\norganization and taking into consideration information system capabilities. For example: Dobri\nHristov (also seen as Dobri Khristov, Добри Христов). This convention is designed to ensure\nthat vital forensic information is not lost.\n\nFor names of persons who are known to not be part of the Bulgarian-speaking community, use\nthe relevant IC transliteration standard for names from that language (e.g., Yitzhak). A\ntranslator’s note may be used to clarify the known origin of the person. Spell names of\nindividuals from languages that are written in Roman letters as they are spelled in those\nlanguages (e.g., George Clooney, Jorge Garcia, Georges Pompidou).\n\nIn the case of active senior government officials in the on-line CIA World Factbook and the online directory of Chiefs of State and Cabinet Members of Foreign Governments, the spellings\ngiven in these on-line reference works should be used in place of the IC Standard. For any\nindividual who has at one time been listed in the Factbook or Chiefs of State directory but who no\nlonger appears in those resources (i.e. is no longer a government official), the IC Standard\nspelling should appear first, with the spelling, if known, as it previously appeared in those\nresources listed within parentheses at the first usage.\n\nThe primary goal is to produce a consistent Romanized transcription of names that is specifically\nreadable to the English-speaking non-specialist. The system uses the 26 letters of the standard\n(English) Roman alphabet. Some ambiguities in the Romanized form will occur without the use\nof diacritics. However, within the context of a report, where additional information about the\nindividual is provided, the referent will be clearly identified. This system will be used in\nconjunction with on-line tools, name dictionaries, and lists containing conventional spellings of\nnames of well-known individuals.\n",

It is based on a standard established by the Congress of Orientalists at Athens in 1912.\nThe International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is a transliteration scheme that allows the lossless romanisation of Indic scripts[citation needed] as employed by Sanskrit and related Indic languages. It is based on a scheme that emerged during the nineteenth century from suggestions by Charles Trevelyan, William Jones, Monier Monier-Williams and other scholars, and formalised by the Transliteration Committee of the Geneva Oriental Congress, in September 1894.IAST makes it possible for the reader to read the Indic text unambiguously, exactly as if it were in the original Indic script. It is this faithfulness to the original scripts that accounts for its continuing popularity amongst scholars.",

The table was published in volume\nII of the conference report.\nIn UN resolution XI/3 it is specifically stated that the\nsystem was recommended for the “romanization of the\ngeographical names within those Arabic-speaking countries\nwhere this system is officially adopted”. There is\nevidence of its partial implementation in Jordan, Oman and\nSaudi Arabia. The UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization\nSystems intends to continue monitoring the UN system’s\nimplementation across Arabic-speaking countries.\nIn some countries there exist local romanization schemes\nor practices. The geographical names of Algeria, Djibouti,\nMauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are generally rendered in\nthe traditional manner which conforms to the principles of\nthe French orthography.\nThe previous UN-approved system is still found in\nconsiderable international usage.\nArabic is written from right to left. The Arabic script\nusually omits vowel points and diacritical marks from\nwriting which makes it difficult to obtain uniform results\nin the romanization of Arabic. It is essential to identify\ncorrectly the words which appear in any particular name\nand to know the standard Arabic-script spelling including\nthe relevant vowels. One must also take into account\ndialectal and idiosyncratic deviations. The romanization\nis generally reversible though there may be some ambiguous\nletter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which may also point to\ncombinations of Arabic characters in addition to the\nrespective single characters.\n",

      "description": "This romanization system agreed by BGN and PCGN in November 2007,\naccommodates the linguistic complexity of Afghanistan as manifest in\nits geographical names.\n\nThe following tabulation shows the original Perso-Arabic script with\naccompanying Unicode value (columns 1a and b), the Yaghoubi\nromanization (column 2), the BGN/PCGN romanization with accompanying\nUnicode value (columns 3a and b), an English phonetic example (column\n4), and an example toponym (columns 5b and c).\n\n[The Yaghoubi romanization system was developed in 1959 by\nMuzaffarud Din Yaqubi (commonly seen as Yaghoubi). It is a native\nofficial system designed to reflect Afghan names, both Dari and Pashto,\nand both pronunciation and genuine linguistic truth.]\n\nThe tables function as both a romanization system for Afghanistan (i.e.\nwith access to the original script, these tables can be applied to get\na standardized Roman result - moving from columns 1 to 3) and as a\nmeans of converting the available Yaghoubi Roman-script spellings, as\nappear on the Fairchild Aerial Surveys map series, to standard BGN/PCGN\nspellings (moving from columns 2 to 3).\n\nThe points used in Arabic to mark short vowels and certain other\ndiacritical marks are infrequently written in Afghanistan.\nConsequently, a reference source may sometimes be required to aid\ncorrect identification of the standard spellings and proper vowels and\nelimination of dialectal and idiosyncratic variations. In the interests\nof clarity, the example columns show script with vowel pointing from\nArabic to indicate the short vowels that are included alongside the\nunpointed form that will usually be encountered. However it should be\nnoted that the pronunciation of short vowels will vary.\n\nNote: it is recommended that a font such as Scheherazade, available\nfrom www.sil.org, which includes the Unicode extended Arabic sub-range,\nbe used to view this system. [Please note that the identification of a\nparticular font does not represent an endorsement of any specific\nproduct or manufacturer.]\n",
      "notes": [
        "Alif (ا) should be romanized as follows:\n\na. Initially, it indicates that the word begins with a vowel or\n  diphthong; the alif itself is not romanized, but rather the short vowel\n  it “carr es” is romanized; e.g., ميړ أَسَلم ژرَندَه → Mī Aslam Zhrandah\nb. When it carries a maddah (آ) (see vowel table, row 6), it\n  represents ā; e.g., آب بَند → Āb Band.\nc. Medially and finally it represents ā (see vowel table, row 5);\n  e.g., ماڼۍ → Māṉêy\nd. Medially and finally in words of Arabic origin, alif may serve\n  as the bearer of hamzah, e.g. رأس → ra’s.\n",
        "Occasionally the letter sequences سه ,زه ,که, and گه occur without intervening vowels. They may be romanized k·h, z·h, s·h, and g·h in order to differentiate these romanizations from the digraphs kh, zh, sh, and gh, which are used to represent the letters ش ,ژ ,خ, and غ. Additionally, the Pashto letters څ and ځ, routinely romanized ts and dz, may be alternatively romanized s and z تس when for special reasons it is desired that confusion be avoided with the character sequences (ts) and دز (dz), respectively.",
        "The vagaries of written Afghan languages, as pertains to spacing and word division, are addressed as follows: Spaces may be added to or subtracted from Afghan words written in Arabic script, for the purposes of standardization. This is particularly relevant when the words are hand-written, are rendered “art st cally”, or express other s ch non-standard flourishes, as long as the sense of the toponym, word, or phrase is not compromised. Romanized toponyms are typically divided into constituent words (spaces and other grammatical rules applied) when those words can stand independently, for purposes of standardization and minimization of confusion, particularly in situations where Afghan writers are inconsistent in their application of spacing and word breaks. When the Afghan word or suffix is only used in combination with other nouns or adjectives, then it should be appended to the preceding word in its romanization. This includes (but is not limited to) - ābā , -zaī, -zā ah, - ū, -wand, -gaī, -kaī, -pūr, - ēsh, -lar, -lī, -lū and ullāh, as, for example, seen in Raḩmatābād (رحمت آباد) and Raḩmatullāh (رحمت االله), but Raḩmat Khēl (رحمتخيل) and Raḩmat Shahr (رحمتشهر).",
        "The one-letter words د (Pashto) and و (Dari) are romanized dê and wa, respectively.",
        "The word الله, meaning God, should always be romanized Allāh, except as specified in note 3. Note that the Unicode value FDF2 spells Allāh, but omits the alif in some common fonts, including Times New Roman. If in doubt, try in Arial Unicode MS to verify. Also note that the “dagger al f” ( ) above the second ل (lām) n the ord الله, is not written but should be romanized ā, like a full-size alif.",
        "In names of Arabic origin, the l of the definite article al s ass m lated before the ‘s n letters’ , , , , r, z, s, sh, ş, ẕ, , z, l and n. In its romanization, the article should be separated from the name it precedes and should not be capitalized except at the beginning of a name, e.g. جبل السراج→ Jabal as Sarāj",
        "In Arabic names, a shaddah, ّ is used to denote the doubling of a particular consonant character, e.g. ُم َح َمد → Muḩammad. Ho ever, n Pashto th s ‘do bl ng’ s freq ently om tted n both Perso- Arabic script and the resulting romanization. Guidance on doubling may be taken from an authoritative names source, such as an Afghan government source or Pashto dictionary; for example, it is usual to see Ḩājī without and ‘Abbās with the doubled consonant. The doubled y consonant is almost always retained, as in Sayyid or Qayyūm.",
        "In Afghan names which contain an iẕāfah, it should be romanized as -e or –ye according to common pronunciation, but generally, -e is used if the preceding word ends with a consonant other than silent heh, and -ye if the preceding word ends with a vowel sound e.g. غر ِحصار → Ghar-e ِ Ḩ şār; َقل َع ٔه َنو → Qal‘ah-ye Now. Scholarly sources indicate that heh is silent in darah and qal‘ah (thus darah-ye, qal‘ah-ye), but lightly spoken in kōh and chāh (thus kōh-e, chāh-e).",
        "The character sequence خو, where followed by ا or ی should be romanized khwā or khwī, although the w is either not pronounced, or only weakly so, as in خواجه → khwājah.",
        "Plural nouns ending in -hā or -ān should always be romanized as a single word, regardless of whether a space appears in a Perso-Arabic script source.",
        "Unicode values listed in the tables above are required to ensure standardization and to minimize confusion from competing representations of a given character. It should be noted that the Persian Unicode value 0643 or FEDA( ك Unicode value 06A9) is recommended rather than the Arabic( ک or FED9), the Persian گ (Unicode value 06AF) is recommended rather than ګ (Unicode value 06AB) or ڰ (Unicode value 06B0) or ك (Unicode value 0643 or FEDA or FED9), and the Pashto character ځ (Unicode value 0681) is recommended rather than the heh with a dot above and a dot below (no Unicode value). For the letter ی in its many variations, care must be exercised to follow this romanization guide's recommendations to eliminate confusion for search engines and software.

It is based on a scheme that emerged during the nineteenth century from suggestions by Charles Trevelyan, William Jones, Monier Monier-Williams and other scholars, and formalised by the Transliteration Committee of the Geneva Oriental Congress, in September 1894.IAST makes it possible for the reader to read the Indic text unambiguously, exactly as if it were in the original Indic script.

      "description": "The United Nations recommended romanization\nsystem was approved in 1972 (resolution II/8),\nbased on the system adopted by Arabic experts at\nthe conference held at Beirut in 1971 with the\npractical amendments carried out and agreed upon\nby the representatives of the Arabic-speaking\ncountries at their conference. The table was\npublished in volume II of the conference report1\n. In the UN resolution it was specifically\npointed out that the system was recommended \"for\nthe romanization of the geographical names within\nthose Arabic-speaking countries where this system\nis officially acknowledged\". It cannot be\ndefinitely ascertained which of the\nArabicspeaking countries have adopted this system\nofficially, especially since 2007 when there are\nefforts by the Arabic Division to promote a\nmodification of the UN system (ADEGN\nromanization, see the section on other\nromanization systems below), with varying\nsuccess2 . Judging by the use of names in\ninternational cartographic products which rely\nmostly on national sources it appears that the UN\nsystem or its modification is more or less\ncurrent in Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia3 ,\nUnited Arab Emirates and Yemen, there and in some\nother countries the system is often used without\ndiacritical marks. For the geographical names of\nthe Syrian Arab Republic international maps\nfavour the UN system while the local usage seems\nto prefer a French-oriented romanization. Also in\nEgypt and Sudan there exist local romanization\nschemes or practices side by side with the UN\nsystem. The geographical names of Algeria,\nDjibouti, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia are\ngenerally rendered in the traditional manner\nwhich conforms to the principles of the French\northography. Resolution 7 of the Seventh UN\nConference on the Standardization of Geographical\nNames (1998) recommended that \"the League of Arab\nStates should, through its specialized\nstructures, continue its efforts to organize a\nconference with a view to considering the\ndifficulties encountered in applying the amended\nBeirut system of 1972 for the romanization of\nArabic script, and submit, as soon as possible, a\nsolution to the United Nations Group of Experts\non Geographical Names\". At the Eighth UN\nConference on the Standardization of Geographical\nNames (2002), the Arabic Division of the UN Group\nof Experts announced that it had finalised\nproposed modifications to the UN recommended\nromanization system. These proposals would be\nsubmitted to the League of Arab States for\napproval. Arabic is written from right to left.\nThe Arabic script usually omits vowel points and\ndiacritical marks from writing which makes it\ndifficult to obtain uniform results in the\nromanization of Arabic. It is essential to\nidentify correctly the words which appear in any\nparticular name and to know the standard Arabic-\nscript spelling including proper pointing. One\nmust also take into account dialectal and\nidiosyncratic deviations. The romanization is\ngenerally reversible though there are some\nambiguous letter sequences (dh, kh, sh, th) which\nmay also point to combinations of Arabic\ncharacters in addition to the respective single\ncharacters.\n",
